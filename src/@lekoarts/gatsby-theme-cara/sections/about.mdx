## About   

#### Innovation is my Passion. Am a Full-Stack Web and a Data Analyst bringing ideas to life.Believer that Tech only makes sense at the service of people!

##### I am proficient  with Python, React.js, Laravel, PHP, Django, RubyonRails, git, Java-android, Spring-Boot and Database dev and management ie. mySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL and Oracle.

I don't like to define myself by the work I've done. I define myself by the work I want to do. Skills can be taught, Personality is inherent.
I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself and do interesting things that matter.
